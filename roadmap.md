10. **Testing with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
    - Testing components in a server-side rendered application.
    - Ensuring components behave correctly when rendered on the server.

11. **Testing Mobile-specific Components (with React Native)**
    - If your project also includes React Native, testing components specific to mobile environments.

12. **Testing in Different Environments**
    - Ensuring components behave correctly in different browsers or environments.
